This repository contains BigWig formatted coverage data for RNA Pol2 (pSer5) ChIP-seq in staged *Drosophila* blastoderm embryos and is associated with a prior publication: [Blythe and Wieschaus, Cell (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.01.050). The data are average normalized counts per 10 bp window as mapped to the *Drosophila* genome, version **dm6**.
Please see the cited work for additional details of how the samples were generated. Raw data is available through GEO/SRA at accession number [GSE62925](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62925).

The available timepoints for wild-type are:

1. NC12
2. NC13
3. NC14 early
4. NC14 mid
5. NC14 late

There is also one timepoint (NC13) from *zelda<sup>294<sup>* germline clone embryos. These can be compared directly with the wild-type NC13 sample to see the (often dramatic) effect of loss of function for *zelda*.
